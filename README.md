# Testing an Interactive Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

**Description**: This project implements and tests a simple Rock, Paper, and Scissors game using Jest and Selenium.

**Technologies Used**:
- JavaScript
- Jest 
- Selenium

## Unit Testing
The game was unit tested using both code-based methods (e.g., code coverage, branch coverage) and specification-based methods (e.g., equivalence class testing) with Jest. 

## Integration Testing
Integration testing involved using Jest "spies," which are mocks of functions that retain their original implementations but add tracking capabilities. This allows developers to "spy" on interactions between components without altering their behavior. 

## System Testing
End-to-end testing was employed with Selenium to verify states and behaviors of the game across different browsers.
